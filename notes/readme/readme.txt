                                ## Welcome to PackageManager!

The purpose of this project is to package all the files into a single file, and then load them.
You can choose to use encryption to make your files even more secure. It is an alternative to using
the default "data.win".


                              ## Simple tutorial on how to use:

A package is a file that contains several others inside.
First, you must generate the content to be added to the package only once.
In each package you put all the files you want. You can create as many packages as you like
(eg one for sprites, others for sounds, fonts, 3d models...).

You need to include the >generated files< in your game, to load them later. You should NOT regenerate
the files again in-game, if your goal is just to load them into the game. Unless you are adding modding
to your game, which is also a possibility, when using this library. :)
